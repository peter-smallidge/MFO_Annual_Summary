## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 




The first set of code reads and makes wide the summary reports.
The second set of code, about line # 444, reads and makes wide the visit request data.

```
DATA PREPARATION

The data files from the MFO qualtrics should be downloaded and saves as *.xlxs file type.
Download the data as "choice text" and another file for "numeric". 
Retain all header lines.  
Delete the dates that won't be included in the report.
Clean the alpha characters from "acres" and "years"

```{r read visit request data, echo=F, include=T, message=F, eval=T}



#read01_choice <- read_excel("visit_request_start_thru_sept2023.xlsx", skip=2, col_names = F)  

#read02_choice <- read_excel("visit_request_start_thru_sept2023.xlsx", n_max = 1) %>%   [n_max will limit the number of rows read]
#  clean_names()

#write_csv(read02_choice, "request_variable_names_choice.csv")

read01_numeric <- read_excel("visit_request_data_numeric_sept2023_august2024.xlsx", skip=2, col_names = F)
  # "skip=2" ignores the first two rows.
  # [col_names = F treats first row as data and assigns columns as x1, x2, x3, etc]
  # these effectively eliminate the three header rows

read01_numeric = read01_numeric[-1,] 
  # the [-1,] code removes the first line of the datafile, thus the columns named x1, x2, x3, etc.
  # the resultant file is just the data

read02_numeric <- read_excel("visit_request_data_numeric_sept2023_august2024.xlsx", n_max = 1) %>% 
  clean_names() 
  # this creates a df with the first row of qualtrics output as variable names, and the actual variable names as the data.
  
  read02_numeric = read02_numeric[-1,]
  # this code "[-1,]" removes the variable names as the data and keeps the first row of the qualtrics output, renamed below.

write_csv(read02_numeric, "request_variable_names_numeric_2024.csv")



```

```{r}
#create an output file, then assign the modified variable names to the output file
request_data01 <- read01_numeric
names(request_data01) <- names(read02_numeric)
