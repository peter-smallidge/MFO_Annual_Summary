Parents and children have built a large and well maintained camp whose main purpose is to host family gatherings. Large part of parcel is open fields, which is under agricultural assessment. Parents and children would like to set up a long term management plan for the woodlands. I will be meeting with Tim Day, DEC Service Forester in Binghamton this month. Harner family would like me to arrange a meeting for them with Tim and to be present at that meeting. They would like to get a list of consulting foresters from the DEC and interview them to select a forester to help draw up their 480a plan. Would like to put the forest land under long-term professional management. Woods are very typical of Southern Tier, with mostly red maple and aspen. These woods were either open field in the past or cut over a long time ago, lots of multiple stem red maple sprouts. Large areas of woods could use thinning to remove poor quality trees. Harners understand that a lot of thinning could be very beneficial to the woods over the long-term and they are willing to do that.  Recommended that they participate in the Piestrak woods walk in Lindley, NY in June and they are willing to do that. Would be good for them to see what other people have done with their woods.",

His property has frontage along the upper reaches of SnowBird Lake, which is an impoundment on Little Woodhull Creek. His land borders a tributary stream where it enters SnowBird Lake.  Dave's land is primarily damp forest with hemlock, spruce, yellow birch, red maple, and some old black cherry. Dave is interested in tapping sugar maples for home use, but, although I did find a few sugar maple leaves, we did not see any mature sugar maples. Red maples are the dominant maple species. The property is part of the SnowBird Lake Association, which has regulations covering land use and tree management. As such, the Associations discourages harvesting trees larger than 6"" diameter, which eliminates logging as a management activity. Dave uses windfalls and trees he has thinned for firewood and does not intend to do any extensive woodlot management. Dave's primary interest in managing his land is for deer hunting. While we did see tracks and droppings, the deer population may be low; we did not see much evidence of overbrowsing, and there is moderate undergrowth of tree saplings and witches hobble. The surrounding land is almost entirely forest. There is a small meadow on his property. A springfed brook meanders through the meadow. Dave wishes to keep beavers away from his land; they regularly attempt to colonize the stream in the meadow and the tributary to SnowBird Lake. Unfortunately, this is excellent beaver habitat, and Dave has a continual challenge on his hand. He mows the meadow and trims the willows bordering the creek, which may reduce the attractiveness to beavers, but it also decreases available forage for deer. I have agreed with Dave to look into approaches, such as food plots, for increasing the potential for deer.",

They very much want to do the right things with this property and it was a joy to just hang with them for a few hours.  They have a so-so Pine woodlot that sits up high ono the banks of Wynantskill Creek0what a stunning view.  Then they have a large 10-20-30 wooded section  that also have conifers but is laced with great tall oak trees that are to die for.  This section has old stumpos everywhere so we could see that probably 50 years ago it was logged extensively but not damaged and the young stock is now filled with 15-20 inch diameter oak, tall and straight. A lot of them.  I was able to advise them about not just letting a logger come in an do a diameter-limit cut.  It is more or less and even aged stand.  There was a lot more I could estimate regarding the history of this parcel given it is a stone's throw away from suburban settlement on all sides. I did a joint MFO visit to Shane and Erica's land and then we as a group drove up to the very end of Bower Rd in Stephentown and did a similar walk with AJ Scheenberg and his wife Kate 23 acre parcel.  These two young couple are the cutting edget of new owners who value their woodlot and want to be deeply engaged and work on their properties.  AJ had also requested and MFO visit I think.  I know AJ as he is now a primed board member of the RPA.   In light of all of the bad things that infact happened nationally on the day I did these visits, both of these young couples are inspirations for the guture of humanity and also for forest management.  what a great day.

Also, I'm quite sure that they'll join NYFOA.  I had the most recent issue of The New York Forest Owner Magazine with me to show them and gave them a $25 coupon.  I think that having a copy of the magazine to show (or give to) woodlot owners is positive.  In fact, I think NYFOA memberships would increase through MFO visits if MFO volunteers had access to ""left over"" magazines to give to woodlot owners along with the $25 coupon ... the magazine is so good that it sells itself!",

The owner would like to do something with this former dump since it the only full sun area, such as berries of herbs; however this would require substantial soil addition.  The forest itself has a few magnificent maples and oaks, but is mainly vine choked low quality locust, black and yellow birch, beech, cottonwood and white pine. There are some safety concerns since there are many broken trees with dangling boughs. The owner said she would take a safety course in chainsaw technique. There are also several old apple trees that are still bearing that could be renovated through proper pruning. There are some sugar maple at the top of the ravine which  presents the possibility of maple sugaring by gravity. The trails could benefit from erosion control such as rocks or ties horizontally to break the water. The owner is interested in sugaring, mushroom cultivation, ginseng and silviculture and encouraging of wild turkeys. This owner does not live on this property but is frequently there and involved since she has a sheep dog and her sheep there (fenced). The owner would participate in Cornell Extension workshops online and locally. Due to the erosion risk and the vine proliferation, this property cannot just be left as is without damage to the forest and soil. There is virtually no way to get felled trees out due to the steep ravine and the owner is not interested in timber harvesting or firewood at this time. ",

The Brubakers were very interested in knowing what kind of trees they have in their woodlot (a mix mainly consisting of cherry, ash, hard maple, beech, yellow birch, and aspen; lesser numbers of hemlock, and muscle-wood.)  We recommended marking their boundaries and posting the property.  Also, they wanted advice on trail building. Mr. Brubaker recently purchased a chainsaw and has been clearing a main trail.  MFOs strongly recommended he take the Game of Logging chainsaw safety training.  Will follow up by providing information on 480-A and The Game of Logging courses in their area.

I did promise to get back to him regarding confirmation of my beliefs.",

As we learned later, the neighbor's house was a total loss and Mr. and Mrs. Walters wanted to assist their elderly neighbor right away.  In fact, they had rescued the homeowner's two dogs just before we arrived.  Based on the information Mr. Walters provided on his intake form, MFOs quickly provided him written information about locating a consulting forester, some suggestions about setting up a timber harvest, and a list of associations which might be of interest to him (e.g. NYFOA, Catskill Forest Association, The My Woodlot website, etc).  MFOs agreed to be available in the future for a more complete visit when things settle down.  Note that Mr. and Mrs. Walters live full time in NJ and use their place in Burlington Flats as a woodland retreat. MFOs understood that Mr. Walters, a retired police officer, wanted to help his neighbor and insure that his own property was not affected by the fire.",

Some more mature which seemed to maybe have SOME boring, no browning or yellowing patches. But a virtual or actual woods walk through an Ash tree stand, and comments as to prospects of soil drench etc might be helpful. My knee-jerk response has always been, ""don't waste your money"".  But possibly CCE has a more professional response to a woods owner. (2) since there seems to be a recent push toward ""mentoring"" and opening visits up to multiple MFOs, should the structure of this report not allow for that fact? ie, there is only one MFO email slot, one MFO name slot, etc  Maybe put a question upfront in the report as to whether it was joint MFO visit  or solo, to allow for your data gathering and maybe help you gather retention statistics on new MFOs. Also, I tried to copy and paste this report to send to my co-MFO on the visit (Glenda Berman). Could not execute that. Maybe there’s some digital workaround??

The canopy was mostly closed but if there was an additional harvest, invasives would be introduced and forest regeneration might not occur.  We suggested the landowner work with a forester (I gave him information from DEC about finding a forester as well as the logs to lumber fact sheer; Jonathan to send him two names) to improve the health of the existing lot prior to the removal of more trees.  There were lots of grapevines, bittersweet and honeysuckle on the property.

Consequently, it is difficult for the average suburban ""backyard"" tree owner who visits the CCE website to  understand that  the way to access resources is by first selecting  ""Environment"" then picking ""Forest Connect"".  (https://cals.cornell.edu/cornell-cooperative-extension/our-work/environment).   Since the challenges backyard  owners face are often similar to those that  apply to larger woodlots/forests just on a much smaller scale, they could only benefit from connecting to Forest Connect (pun intended).   Please consider expanding the picks  on the CCE website to include a category for ""Backyard"" tree/woodlot owners and expanding the conversation to acknowledge these owners share some common concerns.

Th owner was encouraged to make an appointment with a DEC forester who could assess the issues with the property and trees. There is an. old sugar shack on the property and many mature maples. The owner's son and grandson might bee interested int maple sugaring. There are large patches of fern growth within the forest and many damaged trees and dangling branches. The owner was not sure if this was something he could deal with himself or should hav e dealt with professionally. ",

I own my woodland primarily for recreation, relaxation, and the natural beauty of the woods.  &lt;&lt;MFO comments&gt;&gt; You have a property that was pretty clear from the usual invasive plants that we see in Northeastern Columbia County. The invasives common up here in the Northeastern part of the county are the Japanese stilt grass, autumn olive, multiflora rose and oriental bittersweet. Most of the time these seeds travel on tires, and peoples’ shoes so it is necessary to be vigilant.  Your first comments to us were that you wished to understand your property better. I have included links to various resources available to you, including those you received as hard copy from Shane, and hope that they are helpful.  For the purposes of discussion, I'd like to segregate your property into the area where we entered the property (lowlands) and the area where you plan to put up the house (higher plateau). The lowlands cover the area of the former logging road and is a slightly lower elevation and the higher land is south of the creek that runs through the property. The land near the logging road was wet with an abundance of ferns, which flourish in damp, rich soil. The rest of the property was wooded, though not too heavily because it had been logged periodically. The loggers seem to have taken care of the land harvesting a variety of trees and leaving  a variety of trees behind. You have hardwoods (oak, maples) and some valuable timber such as black cherry. There are also eastern pine and birches interspersed among these trees. You do not appear to have stands of one particular species.  The first question you had was about ticks. Ticks are, as you know, ubiquitous this year because of the relatively mild winter we had. It is best to protect yourselves. You were wearing wellingtons, which is a good thing. It is best to have a couple of sets of clothing (pants and long sleeved shirt), your hats, gloves, and shoes sprayed with permethrin (Sawyer Products SP657 Premium Permethrin Insect Repellent for Clothing, Gear & Tents, Trigger Spray, sold at Amazon). Allow clothing to dry and wash hands well after use as this is a toxic product. This treatment is good for about 6 washes. Information about ticks and tick- borne diseases https://www.cdc.gov/ticks/tickbornediseases/tickID.html,  https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/11/well/tick-disease-lyme.html?action=click&pgtype=Article&state=default&module=styln-ticks&variant=show&region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc Please feel free to go to your local government sites as well.  Forest Age and Maturity: Shane and I reviewed your intake form to address any specifics you might want covered. Our assumption was that for many years your land was part of a larger parcel of forested land and had not been used for crop production probably due to the presence of wet areas/wetlands. Our guess that it was probably used for timber production under section 480-a of the Real Property Tax Law when it was part of a larger piece of land.  Most of your property has a combination of hardwoods. There is some infiltration of witch hazel that grows about 6-8 ft tall and spreads out tending to shade out younger plants and not allow robust new growth. These are some of the bushes you might want to cull. Our main concern is that throughout the property, there is very little understory regeneration of trees. It is what folks at Cornell describe as an ""even-aged"" forest. The trees are maybe 50-60 years old and in some cases may be older. There appeared to be a stone wall which suggests that there may have been a farm for crops or livestock many years ago. However, based on the lack of quick growing trees or invasives this may not be an accurate conclusion. This presumption can be easily confirmed with some searching of the Agricultural Census schedule data that farmers were required to complete in mid-19th century. If you are curious just ask. More reading material: https://smallfarms.cornell.edu/2022/10/anticipating-the-next-forest-ecology-and-management-for-sustaining-forests/  Stewardship Plan: otherwise known as David and Roberta’s to-do list. We think it is helpful to plan out proposed landscape level changes by breaking them out into bite-sized projects.   We would suggest starting with the area of your proposed building site. In the meantime, try to keep your loppers (and electric chainsaw? Chainsaw safety: http://ccecolumbiagreene.org/family-consumer-sciences/family-economics-community-resiliency/emergency-preparedness/chainsaw-safety) handy to remove any unwanted species.  For ease of tractor access, I would probably start on the logging road. It is best to convert this road into your driveway as it has been drivable, and the relative pitch is gradual.  The building site (higher land): This area has some valuable trees. It may be a good idea to get a forester to harvest them and give you some cash or use it as payment for assessing the rest of your property. This may be something you should do sooner rather than later so you can benefit from them. They will probably grade the area as well.  The lower area is populated with ferns. This may be an ideal spot to plant some trees. You can use the USDA soil survey map to determine which trees will do well. Your property's Soil Map from the USDA-NRCS. (https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/app/WebSoilSurvey.aspx)  You can get an idea about the type of soil in your particular area, if you decide to add trees.  Perspective on Tree Growth should you choose to plant in the lowlands (see caveat under ""water control"") Willow: You have already planted one in the wet area. They do well in wet areas and are fast growing. Some of the other trees are listed below:  The ferns are invasive and hard to eradicate especially if the land continues to be wet. One would have to use a herbicide. I would suggest some trees be planted in the area where the ferns currently are. Planting a tree forces clearing the ground of ferns and digging a large enough hole to put in a young tree. Some of the trees for wet areas are suggested below. In addition, you can also plant hardwoods that are already present on your property in areas where there is a lack of trees. The aim is to have trees of varying ages so you have a ground story with grasses, (if the sunlight reaches it), a middle story with younger trees and an upper story with mature trees.  Black Walnut: should you ever decide to embark on adding trees, this species could be good for the lower land where the ferns are plentiful because (1) it is nut-bearing, thus positive for wildlife; (2) it grows well in rich alluvial soils; (3) it is allelopathic, keeps invasives at bay (via its juglone chemical), but do not put your vegetable garden near it; (4) it makes beautiful flooring, should you want to take one of them down for Black Walnut flooring for your daughter's house in 30 years.  Silver Maple: Can be planted in a swampish area and is a fast grower. Sycamore: Another fast grower and does not mind wet feet.  Apart from the hardwoods on your property you have black cherry trees. These trees do not mind wet feet either and are monetarily valuable to grow. They would make great furniture/cabinet material if you ever decided to harvest them. Be aware that these trees may suffer from Gummosis -- Black Cherry trees ooze a dark gelatinous substance from their bark, which often happens when they are stressed, for example when there is an extremely dry spell.  All of the above listed trees need full sunlight and should grow well if there is no competition and might reduce the harm being done by ferns. As you get more familiar with trees, you can add sugar maple (a stand of them can provide maple syrup) and burr oak could also prosper in wettish areas.  Mushroom cultivation: You expressed a wish to grow mushrooms and ginseng on your property. The Cornell Cooperative Extension of Columbia/Greene County has classes offered periodically throughout the year. You need a water source and shade, which you have in the area near the stream, for growing shitake. A source of hardwood logs too is required and you should keep that in mind when trees are being demolished for your house. You can find the courses offered on the right-hand side of the web page. https://ccecolumbiagreene.org/. If you get on their email list, they will send you monthly reminders.  Water control: You have a stream that runs through your property. You would like to enlarge it so that you have a stream that runs more or less throughout the year and not only during the early spring. You would need to determine where the source of the water is so that you know if your source of water is clean. If it is, then you can perhaps have a little pond that will provide some resource for the birds.  Invasive parasites and other dead trees:   Emerald Ash Borer... Impossible to mitigate at this stage. If you have ash trees (we did not note any) they tend to die off in this area from the emerald ash borer incursion. Ash can be used for firewood or standing snag as shelter for animals. It is sometimes useful to keep standing dead trees, they are a haven for birds and small mammals and insects and provide a food source.  Invasive Plants: Although you had no invasive plants that we could see, this information will help if you see invasives appear. The entire following video link is excellent.   I find it helpful and somewhat complete from the acknowledged expert in the area of invasives control at Penn State U Ag Extension, Dave Jackson.  Identifying and Controlling Invasive Plants on Forestland If you choose to 'cut to the chase' (again) below are the relevant time points in the video for you:  Japanese Stiltgrass is at 14:00 of the video.  Oriental Bittersweet at 33:38.  Japanese Barberry at 42:13.  Honeysuckle at 43:57 Tree of Heaven at 50:28  Government Assistance--  (a) The NYS Trees for Tribs program—If you want to keep the wet areas from erosion, this program helps. Twenty-five trees given to you, if your application is approved. Need to apply first. https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/77710.html  If you have questions, you may email them at TreesForTribs@dec.ny.gov or call them at (518) 402-94  DEC Regenerate NY Forestry Cost Share Program. You pay 20% of the total bill. You will need to hire/designate a forester and have a plan. Minimum grant from NYS is $10,000 which means your minimum cost under the program is $2,500 on a bill of $12,500. This is granted as a first come, first serve process and stops when the money runs out. Project can take 3 years; so you can amortize your outlay. They have an approved list of contractors to do the work. https://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/119950.html   There are chainsaw classes held by a forester named Bill Lindoff. The class is called Game of Logging. He can be reached at either of these links. If he cannot help you with the clearing of trees at you house site, you can ask him for a recommendation. If you draw a blank there, you can go to the DEC list and pick someone who lives closest to you. http://www.gameoflogging.com/  This site offers many classes, and it is worth attending these classes to learn about chainsaw safety. https://www.nycamh.org/programs-and-services/game-of-logging.php  There are also chainsaw classes for women taught at the Cornell Cooperative Extension taught by Tracey Testo.  The class for women carries the same name.  (c) The DEC Saratoga Nursery sells trees every year at great prices, typically starting in January. The good stuff goes quickly, so you need to keep your eye out on their site. Here's is the link for the 2022 sale back in January:  https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/75799.html  (d) Sales of trees take place each year, in the counties...by the County Soil and Water Conservation Districts, at discounted prices. Specifically Albany, Columbia and Greene counties recently. The Soil and water conservation is administered by people who are also members of the Cornell Cooperative extension.

Refer to his log for the major highlights from the visit.,

Perhaps this exists but I didn't see it - not as comprehensively in one place as I'm describing here, at least.  I would be happy to help plan and create such a resource if needed - I do corporate communications professionally and have experience in these efforts. ",

They have marked their boundaries with posted signs and paint, they have worked with a forester to develop a management plan, and have contacted DEC regarding the development of a 480A plan. We walked the property - a beautiful parcel only half a mile down the road from my house! Their main areas of focus for the visit were to discuss tree identification (we went through a key and identified the main hardwood species, plus willow, aspen etc), identifying and managing interfering vegetation (multi-flora rose, hawthorn, honeysuckle and, unfortunately, japanese knotweed), and some basics about pests and diseases (EAB, beech bark disease, beech leaf disease). In each case I emphasized that there are resources available to help them learn about these topics, and I shared several pdfs and URLs that I'd been given during my training.",
